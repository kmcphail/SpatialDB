## Avian GeoSearch
### Utilizing data-driven research to spatially locate bird species & accessible lands
#### Kirk McPhail, Dorn Moore




### Section 1: Introduction & Objectives

- [X] **Introduction**:
 - [X] KM
 - [X] DM

In the age of online collaboration, the scientific research community at large has gained the ability to readily share their findings with the public. Likewise, so has the general population; thus, the concept of citizen science has thrived. One of our primary sources, eBird, is a prime example of an organization that utilizes data from these self-titled citizen scientists. The Cornell Lab of Ornithology and National Audubon Society pooled their resources in 2002, resulting into what is now "â€¦one of the largest and fastest growing biodiversity data resources in existence." (eBird.org).

There is a considerable community of dedicated birders who use technology to network with fellow birders seeking opportunities to observe more birds in their home town or favorite vacation spot. However, for non-birders or novices, it can be difficult to discover where to see a particular species or find a list of common species seen a particular area. For example, at the International Crane Foundation, where one of the authors works, it is a common question from visitors to our site or website to ask "Where can I see Sandhill cranes near me?" Our goal with this project was to help bring together the over 274 million eBird species sightings in the United States to help people find birds.
    
- [X] **Research Questions**:
 - [X] KM
 - [X] DM

From the early planning stages of this project, our primary objective has been to create a platform that answers variations of three questions: 

- What bird species can I see nearby? 
- Where can I see a certain species nearby? 
- When can I see a certain species nearby? 

The first question demonstrates the minimum requirement when building a proper query statement for use in our database; a user must designate a search location. Building on this stipulation, the second and third questions allow for bird species as an additional parameter. More detailed queries may include specifying a certain month, natural area, or any combination of the aforementioned variables. This project focuses on solutions to these concerns through the design, creation, and implementation of a spatial database, along with custom functions, joins, and relationships.
    
- [X] **Data Description & Sources**:
 - [X] KM
 - [X] DM

Three main sources form our database: the eBird Basic Dataset from Cornell, the Protected Areas Database of the United States from USGS, and TIGER/Line Shapefiles from the U.S. Census Bureau. The download for the former source consists of a tab-delimited text file, imported using the SQL copy command and assigned point geometry derived from longitude and latitude field values. The latter two sources were obtained as shapefiles and uploaded using the PostGIS shp2pgsql and psql command line expressions.

 - [ ] DM

Our goal in combining these resources is to develop a bird species search tool that is both comprehensive and practical at a local scale. Although the raw data we obtained has the potential for extensive analytical research, our database will primarily cater to the average outdoor enthusiast and thus many of the original fields proved unnecessary. We encountered several challenges working with such a vast dataset of species sightings. However, we were able to resolve several of these through query experimentation and will discuss those challenges and solutions in the sections below. 


### Section 2: Database Design, Implementation & Manipulation

- [ ] **Database Design**:
 - [X] KM
 - [ ] DM

We translated our source data into four spatial entities (see ebird, area, state, county in Figure 1) placed in three groups, which are later expressed as schemas during the database implementation phase. The first consists of species observations depicted as points, another contains protected lands with polygon geometry, and the last group holds both states and counties represented as polygons. Given the amount of overlap in field values within each entity, minimizing redundancy via normalization became the next priority. The bulk of non-spatial entities and attributes seen in Figure 1 originate from the area entity. Attributes for some might seem obvious based on names like manager_name and manager_type (e.g. values 'SFW', 'State Fish and Wildlife' for mang_name, d_mang_nam likely relate to 'STAT', 'State' for mang_type, d_mang_typ), but others may need further explanation. The most relevant for casual users is access. Composed of four domains, this entity details the level of public access permissible:
- access
   - OA - 'Open Access'
   - RA - 'Restricted Access'
   - XA - 'Closed'
   - UK - 'Unknown'

Some useful, but more niche entities derived from the area entity include: 
- designation
  - AGRE - 'Agricultural Easement'
  - ...
  - NT = 'National Scenic or Historic Trail'
  - ...
  - WSR - 'Wild and Scenic River'
 
- gap_status
  - 1 - 'managed for biodiversity - disturbance events proceed or are mimicked'
  - 2 - 'managed for biodiversity - disturbance events surpressed'
  - 3 - 'managed for multiple uses - subject to extractive (e.g. mining or loggin) or OHV use'
  - 4 - 'no known mandate for protection'
- iucn_cat
  - Ia - 'Strict nature reserves'
  - Ib - 'Wilderness areas'
  - II - 'National park'
  - III - 'Natural monument or feature'
  - IV - 'Habitat / species management'
  - V - 'Protected landscape / seascape'
  - VI - 'Protected area with sustainable use of natural resources'

 - [X] DM

The database sections were pulled from existing (third-party) databases, namely eBird, the USGS Protected Area Database (USGS PAD), and the US Census Tiger data. In each case, we created separate schema to hold these databases. Our research questions do not require that we keep all of the attributes in each table. We eliminated attribute fields that were not useful for our questions. Further, the database providers often included duplicative fields to make it easier for outside users to query by easy to read fields. For example, the USGS PAD includes both a coded value and descriptive value for a 8 fields (16 in total). In the case of the USGS PAD, we created list tables that are foreign keys and reduce the number of fields stored in the core table. We created a similar table in eBird schema to hold common and scientific names.

To import the eBird data, we used an example found on the web (https://github.com/weecology/retriever/issues/90) to create properly formatted table. Once completed, we uploaded the US eBird data downloaded from their website to the database. The details of this process are described in SQL in _APPENDIX 1_.

Data for the census and usgs_pad schemas were uploaded using the PostGIS SHP2PGSQL command. Once imported the USGS PAD table ("area") was used to create several additional list tables to eliminate 'duplicate' attributes, as described above. Please reference the ER Model (see Figure 1) and Logical Diagram (see Figure 2) for details. We used the state name (census.state.name) as a foreign key in the USGS PAD table (usgs_pad.area.state_nm). There are no longer direct linkages between the tables in different schemas; all other connections are spatial in nature.

For each table, indexes were created on fields pertinent to our core queries. The list includes:

 **ebd.ebird**
 - CREATE INDEX ebird_geom_idx ON ebd.ebird USING GIST (geom);
 - CREATE INDEX ebird_common_name_idx ON ebd.ebird (common_name);
 - CREATE INDEX ebird_scientific_name_idx ON ebd.ebird (scientific_name);
 - CREATE INDEX ebird_month_idx ON ebd.ebird (date_part('month',observation_date);
 - CREATE INDEX ebird_year_idx ON ebd.ebird (date_part('year',observation_date);
 - CREATE INDEX ebird_obsdate_idx ON ebd.ebird (observation_date);

 **usgs_pad.area**
 - CREATE INDEX area_geom_idx ON usgs_pad.area USING GIST (geom);
 - CREATE INDEX area_loc_nm_idx ON usgs_pad.area (loc_nm);
 - CREATE INDEX area_mang_nm_idx ON usgs_pad.area (mang_nm);
 - CREATE INDEX area_unit_nm_idx ON usgs_pad.area (unit_nm);

 **census.state**
 - CREATE INDEX state_geom_idx ON census.state USING GIST (geom);
 - CREATE INDEX county_name_idx ON census.state (name);
 - CREATE INDEX county_statefp_idx ON census.state (statefp);
 - CREATE INDEX county_stusps_idx ON census.state (stusps);

 **census.county**
 - CREATE INDEX county_geom_idx ON census.county USING GIST (geom);
 - CREATE INDEX county_name_idx ON census.county (name);

To answer our core questions, we created several example queries. Below are examples of the queries and results.

Find Protected Areas (without access restrictions) in a particular county that has records of a particular species.

	**QUERY**
	-- A query to find accessible protected areas with certain species. 
	WITH local_sp AS (
		SELECT eb.geom FROM ebd.ebird AS eb
		JOIN census.county AS cn ON ST_INTERSECTS(eb.geom, cn.geom)
		WHERE
			cn.name = 'Dane' AND 
			cn.state = 'WI' AND 
			eb.common_name = 'Sandhill Crane'		
		)
	SELECT up.unit_nm as protected_area, ac.d_access as access_type 
	FROM usgs_pad.area AS up
	JOIN local_sp ON ST_INTERSECTS(local_sp.geom, up.geom)
	JOIN usgs_pad."access" as ac on up."access"=ac."access"
	WHERE up."access"NOT IN ('UK','XA')
	GROUP BY up.unit_nm, ac.d_access
	ORDER BY ac.d_access, up.unit_nm;

	SELECT

		e.scientific_name
	FROM
		ebd.ebird AS e
	JOIN usgs_pad.area AS pa ON ST_Intersects (pa.geom, e.geom)

Find the nearest publicly accessible Protected Area where one might find a particular species this month. This is a pretty complex query and would do well to be transformed into a function.

	**QUERY**
	-- A query to find the nearest PA where a species can be seen (this month and using data since 2015)
	SELECT
		up.unit_nm AS pa_name,
		up.state_nm AS "state",
		ST_Distance (up.geom :: geography, ST_SetSRID(ST_POINT(- 89.7485322, 43.4687975),4326)) / 1000 AS distance_km
	FROM
		usgs_pad.area AS up
	JOIN ebd.ebird e ON ST_INTERSECTS (e.geom, up.geom)
	WHERE
		e.common_name = 'American Bittern'
		AND up."access" NOT IN ('XA', 'UK')
		AND e.observation_date >= '2015-01-01'
		AND date_part('month', e.observation_date) = date_part('month', now())
	GROUP BY up.unit_nm, up.state_nm, up.geom
	ORDER BY
		up.geom <-> ST_SetSRID (
			ST_POINT (- 89.7485322, 43.4687975),
			4326
		)
	LIMIT 10;

	**RESULTS**
		            pa_name                     | state |  distance_km
	------------------------------------------------+-------+----------------
	 Statewide Natural Area                         | WI    |  3.60143062977
	 Dane County Waterfowl Production Area          | WI    | 32.53233368161
	 Quincy Bluff And Wetlands Natural Area         | WI    | 42.59313832168

	 Wood County Forest                             | WI    | 89.32880702701
	(10 rows)

Given the complexity of the above query, we created a function that outputs the same information but allows the user to enter simpler criteria.

	CREATE FUNCTION "ebd"."NewProc"(float8, float8, varchar, int4)
  	RETURNS SETOF "ebd"."_near_pa" AS $BODY$SELECT
		up.unit_nm AS pa_name,
		up.state_nm AS "state",
		ST_Distance (up.geom :: geography, ST_SetSRID(ST_POINT($1, $2),4326)) / 1000 AS distance_km
	FROM
		usgs_pad.area AS up
	JOIN ebd.ebird e ON ST_INTERSECTS (e.geom, up.geom)
	WHERE
		e.common_name = $3
		AND up."access" NOT IN ('XA', 'UK')
		AND e.observation_date >= '2014-01-01'
		AND date_part('month', e.observation_date)::int = $4
	GROUP BY up.unit_nm, up.state_nm, up.geom
	ORDER BY
		up.geom <-> ST_SetSRID (
			ST_POINT ($1, $2),
			4326
		)
	LIMIT 10;$BODY$
  	LANGUAGE 'sql' VOLATILE COST 100
 	ROWS 10
	;

	ALTER FUNCTION "ebd"."NewProc"(float8, float8, varchar, int4) OWNER TO "geog574";

The Query ends up looking like this:

	select ebd.near_pa_for_sp(-89.4021755,43.075816,'Sandhill Crane',5);
